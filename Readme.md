# Telegram Bot Duo

A compact, powerful pair of Telegram bots in one repository—designed and orchestrated using Jupyter and JSON to spark conversations (or commands).

## What's Inside
- `Telegram_bot (4).ipynb`: Your interactive Jupyter notebook where you prototype and test one of the bots. Great for visualizing logic, debugging flows, or documenting usage.
- `Telegram Bot.json`: The configuration or definition file for the other bot—perhaps your token, commands, or structured settings.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thedynasty23/Telegram-Bot.git
    cd Telegram-Bot
    ```

2. **Load the notebook:**
    Open `Telegram_bot (4).ipynb` in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Experiment with the cells—modify variables, run blocks, observe behavior.

3. **Dive into JSON:**
    Open `Telegram Bot.json` to explore or tweak the bot’s configuration. Look for things like tokens, command triggers, API endpoints, or settings.

4. **Run your bot notebooks:**
    If the notebook contains runnable code (likely in Python), ensure dependencies like `python-telegram-bot` or others are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Feel free to create `requirements.txt` if not present.) Then, run the notebook cells to launch the bot.*

5. **Further notes:**
    - Keep your Telegram Bot token secret. Don’t commit it to public places.
    - Consider splitting code into `.py` files if you want to deploy beyond notebooks.
    - If adding more bots or modules, structure folders and notebooks for clarity.

## How It Works (High-Level—Adjust Once You Review)

- **Notebook-based bot**: Interactive exploration, live tweaks, debugging. It’s flexible and perfect for prototypes.
- **JSON-based bot**: Likely driven by a config file—ideal for production or structured deployment.
- **Your choice engine**: Whether you're polling or using webhooks, the tooling behind these files should show that. Document whichever approach you’re using and why.

## Why This Repo Matters

- **Experimentation & clarity**—Jupyter notation meets configuration control.
- **Modular design**—one bot in a notebook, another via config.
- **Your playground**—easy to fork, tweak, iterate, and share.

When you open those files and drop in some context—like dependencies, functions, usage examples, configuration details—we can shim in instructions with finesse. This README is your scaffold; fill the gaps, and we’ll elevate it into a polished project front door that practically whispers “clone me.”

What’s the first thing that stands out when you open the notebook or JSON?
